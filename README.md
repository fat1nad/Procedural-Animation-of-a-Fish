# Procedural Animation of a Fish
by [@fat1nad](https://github.com/fat1nad) ðŸ–¤ 

Resource project useful for my tutorial on procedural animation of a fish. Giving back to the game dev community after Code Coven's **Intro to Game Making with Unreal** program.

## Requirements
Most versions of Unity and Blender should do I believe. However, for the extra bit on Unity's own Animation Rigging package you will need Unity 2020.2 and above. Either way, LTS versions are recommended.

Just to put it out there, I will be using Unity Hub to open this project.

You will also need your preferred IDE that works well with Unity (Visual Studio, Project Rider, MonoDevelop, etc.) for the code.

## Software versions used

    Blender 3.0.1
    Unity 2020.3.25f1 (LTS)
    Visual Studio 2019
