# Procedural Animation of a Fish
 Resource project useful for my tutorial on procedural animation of a fish. Giving back to the game dev community after Code Coven's **Intro to Game Making with Unreal** program.

## Requirements for this tutorial/workshop
Any version of Unity and Blender should do I believe. However, for the extra bit on Unity's own Animation Rigging package you will need Unity 2020.2 and above. Either way, LTS versions are recommended.

You will also need your preferred IDE that works well with Unity (Visual Studio, Project Rider, MonoDevelop, etc.) for the code.

## Software versions that I used

    Blender 3.0.1
    Unity 2020.3.25f1 (LTS)
    Visual Studio 2019
