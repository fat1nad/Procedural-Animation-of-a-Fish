# Procedural Animation of a Fish
by [fat1nad](https://github.com/fat1nad)ðŸ–¤ 

Resource project useful for my tutorial on procedural animation of a fish. Giving back to the game dev community after Code Coven's **Intro to Game Making with Unreal** program.

## Requirements
I have tried to make this tutorial super approachable for those new to Unity. 

If you are not comfortable with programming, you will still be able to have a procedurally animated fish in the end since the code is pre-provided. However, the code is the main part of the procedural animation so I will be going through it in detail.

Most versions of Unity and Blender should work I believe. However, for the extra/bonus bit on Unity's own Animation Rigging package you will need Unity 2020.2 or above. Either way, LTS versions are recommended.

Just to put it out there, I will be using Unity Hub to open this project.

For the code, you will need your preferred IDE that works well with Unity (Visual Studio, Project Rider, MonoDevelop, etc.). 

## Software versions used

    Blender 3.0.1
    Unity 2020.3.25f1 (LTS)
    Visual Studio 2019
