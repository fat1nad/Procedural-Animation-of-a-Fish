# Procedural Animation of a Fish
by [fat1nad](https://github.com/fat1nad)ðŸ–¤ 

Resource project useful for my tutorial on procedural animation of a fish. Giving back to the game dev community after Code Coven's **Intro to Game Making with Unreal** program.

## Requirements
Most versions of Unity and Blender should do I believe. However, for the extra bit on Unity's own Animation Rigging package you will need Unity 2020.2 and above. Either way, LTS versions are recommended.

Just to put it out there, I will be using Unity Hub to open this project.

For the code, you will need your preferred IDE that works well with Unity (Visual Studio, Project Rider, MonoDevelop, etc.).

Programming knowledge is ideal since I will be going over the code. However, you will still be able to follow through and have a procedurally animated fish at the end without having to code, since the code is pre-provided.

## Software versions used

    Blender 3.0.1
    Unity 2020.3.25f1 (LTS)
    Visual Studio 2019
